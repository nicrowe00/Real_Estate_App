# Real Estate App

## Overview
The Real Estate App is a console-based application designed to allow users to upload information about their estates to sell them or to allow users to browse estates currently for sale. Using the app, users can view all the estates currently in the system, view specific estates by entering their id number, add an estate themselves, update information about an estate already in the system, delete an estate from the system or delete all estates from the system.
